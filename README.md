# How to install a Chrome App in Developer Mode from GitHub?

*This guide explains how to install a Chrome app (or extension) in developer mode directly from a folder on GitHub.*

**Prerequisites:**

- A Chromium-based browser (such as Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge, Brave, etc.)
- Download the folder extension from [here](https://github.com/MikixIT/google-translate-dark/archive/refs/tags/1.0.zip).

**Steps:**

1.  **Clone the GitHub repository (or download the folder):**

    You have two options to get your app's files:

    - **Cloning REPO Folder**
      https://github.com/MikixIT/google-translate-dark.git

    - **ZIP Download:** --> [DOWNLOAD](https://github.com/MikixIT/google-translate-dark/archive/refs/tags/1.0.zip)

2.  **Open the Extensions Section page in Chrome:**

    Open your Chrome browser and type `chrome://extensions` in the address bar and press Enter.

3.  **!IMPORTANR Enable "Developer mode":**

    In the top right corner of the `chrome://extensions` page, you'll find a toggle labeled "Developer mode". Turn it on.

4.  **Load unpacked extension:**

    Once "Developer mode" is enabled, you'll see three new buttons: "Load unpacked", "Pack extension", and "Update". Click on "Load unpacked".

5.  **Select the extension folder:**

    A folder selection dialog will open. Navigate to the folder where you cloned the GitHub repository (or where you extracted the ZIP archive) and select the _root folder_ that contains the `manifest.json` file.

6.  **ENJOY and THANKS!**
